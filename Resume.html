<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
  The behaviour of piles under axial loading and impact loading has been challenging for engineers as the design philosophy of this system is mainly based on concepts of conventional design without giving consideration to deformation at pile soil interface surface. 
This is mainly due to complexity in theoretical modelling of interface region.
s When a small displacement (open-ended) pile is driven into the ground, a soil plug may develop within the pile during driving, which may prevent or partially restrict additional soil from entering the pile. 
It is known that the driving resistance and the bearing capacity of open-ended piles are governed to a large extent by this plugging effect
